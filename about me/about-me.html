    <h1>My Journey in the World of Programming</h1>
    <p>
        Since I first ventured into the world of programming, my journey has been exciting and full of discoveries. Although I am still in the early stages of my learning, each step I take on this path brings me a little closer to my goals and fills me with excitement for what comes next.
        
        My story in programming began with a desire to explore the vast universe of technology and understand how the applications and websites we use every day work. I started with HTML and CSS, the languages ​​that shape the structure and layout of web pages. As I learned how to create designs and bring my ideas to life on the screen, I realized that programming was much more than writing code: it was a form of creative expression.
        
        Then came JavaScript, a dynamic language that allowed me to add interactivity to my projects.
        
        Throughout my journey, he faces challenges and moments of frustration, but each obstacle
        
        My goal is to continue growing as a program.
        
        In short, my journey into the world of programming is a testament to my passion for creativity, problem solving, and constant learning. Although I am a beginner.</p>
